It's a challenge! Do you have a stopwatch there? It's a life in 1m29s reading, can you do it? ⏰

I am passionate about project and product management, also in solving problems with excellence. If there's anything to improve, call me! That's why I chose to work in project management in the 3rd sector for 3 years. I've learned a lot about customer service, communication, sales, operations, project and people management, costumer success, data analysis, deal multiple demand, to be result oriented and working in a diverse and exigent environment.

In a management lecture in 2016, I heard the following sentence, entitled to Mandela: “I never lose, either I learn or win”, I identified myself.

The identification came from the fact of going through critical situations in life, poverty, hungriness and sudden changes caused by more complex factors that in the end were great learnings!
With this I became extremely adaptable, resilient, solution and result oriented and above all I'm not limited. Hence the values ​​of Greatness, Freedom and Justice.

By dreaming big I had the privilege of living 1 year in Ukraine working with operations management and CX, in an extraordinary experience managing a successful team, where I was also able to visit 11 countries, passing through 4 different continents, I was living the world and learning more, so I increased my creative capacity and to have better solutions.

Over time, I understood that I must “provide people with access to opportunities that can change their lives” - my purpose - working for it, came the professional and technical skills that I have been learning during all this experience.

Lastly, as a Project Manager, I worked with different products sectors, since real state to games - launching a pioneer product in Brazil, I facilitated 2 products Discoveries and also agile in the company.

Now I'm building something new at Dock!

I use programming to make all this above easy!!
